# Old Files

This folder contains all the old versions of files with their respective naming conventions.

For example, files starting with `Param_Insert_` are used to insert data into the database.

The `shift` file is used for monitoring data in the terminal or console.

## Running the Files

To run a file, simply execute the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    python <filename>.py or python3 <filename>.py or py <filename>.py
    ```
