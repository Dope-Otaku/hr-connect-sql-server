## Projects

### Backend

This project contains the HR table calculation for a microservice.

### basics_micro

This project refers to the online image gallery project where we have connected a variety of tools like an API Gateway (nginx, ocelot) and have created two different backends with different frameworks: one in Flask and one in Django. These use two different databases and are all connected through a message queuing service called RabbitMQ, communicating with each other via internal API endpoints.

### yt_video_code

This project refers to the app built in Angular, powered by Flask as a backend. It reads a URL of a YouTube video and downloads it in different resolutions. This one is also built as a microservice.
